# Constructor

Initialize your consumer contract.

```javascript Solidity
constructor(address _vrfCoordinator, address _link) public
```

* `_vrfCoordinator`: Address of the Chainlink VRF Coordinator. See [Chainlink VRF Addresses](../vrf-contracts/) for details.
* `_link`: Address of the LINK token. See [LINK Token Addresses](../link-token-contracts/) for details.

___

> Note: `_seed` has recently been depreciated.
# Functions

## requestRandomness

Make a request to the VRF coordinator.

```javascript Solidity
function requestRandomness(bytes32 _keyHash, uint256 _fee)
    public returns (bytes32 requestId)
```

* `_keyHash`: The public key against which randomness is generated. See [Chainlink VRF Addresses](../vrf-contracts/) for details.
* `_fee`: The fee, in LINK, for the request. Specified by the oracle.
* `RETURN`: The ID unique to a single request.

## fulfillRandomness

Called by VRFCoordinator when it receives a valid VRF proof. Override this function to act upon the random number generated by Chainlink VRF.

```javascript Solidity
function fulfillRandomness(bytes32 requestId, uint256 randomness)
    external virtual;
```

* `requestId`: The Id initially returned by `requestRandomness`.
* `randomness`: Random number generated by Chainlink VRF.

# Reference

## Maximizing security

Chainlink VRF provides powerful security guarantees and is easy to integrate. However, smart contract security is a nuanced topic.

## Seed Depreciation

Since the ultimate input to the VRF is mixed with the block hash of the block in which the request is made, user-provided seeds have no impact on its economic security properties. They are only included for API compatibility with previous versions of this contract, hence it's depreciation.
