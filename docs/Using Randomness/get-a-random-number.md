## Requirements

This guide assumes that you know how to create and deploy smart contracts on Ethereum testnets using the following tools:

- [The Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
- [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)
- [Rinkeby testnet ETH](/docs/link-token-contracts/#rinkeby)

If you are new to developing smart contracts on Ethereum, see the [Getting Started](/docs/conceptual-overview/) guide to learn the basics.

## Create and fund a subscription

For this example, create a new subscription on the Rinkeby testnet.

1. Open MetaMask and set it to use the Rinkeby testnet. The Subscription Manager detects your network based on the active network in MetaMask.

1. Check MetaMask to make sure you have testnet ETH and LINK on Rinkeby. If you need testnet funds, you can get them from [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/rinkeby).

1. Open the [Subscription Manager](https://vrf.chain.link) page.

1. Click **Create Subscription** and follow the instructions to create a new subscription account. MetaMask opens and asks you to confirm payment to create the account on-chain. After you approve the transaction, the network confirms the creation of your subscription account on-chain.

1. After the subscription is created, click **Add funds** and follow the instructions to fund your subscription. For this example, a balance of 2 LINK is sufficient. MetaMask opens to confirm the LINK transfer to your subscription. After you approve the transaction, the network confirms the transfer of your LINK token to your subscription account.

1. After you add funds, click **Add consumer**. A page opens with your account details and subscription ID.

1. Record your subscription ID, which you need for your consumer contract. You will add the consumer to your subscription later.

You can always find your subscription IDs, balances, and consumers on the [Subscription Manager](https://vrf.chain.link/) page.

Now that you have a funded subscription account and your subscription ID, [create and deploy a VRF v2 compatible contract](#create-and-deploy-a-vrf-v2-compatible-contract).

## Create and deploy a VRF v2 compatible contract

For this example, use the [VRFv2Consumer.sol](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/VRF/VRFv2Consumer.sol) sample contract. This contract imports the following dependencies:

- [VRFConsumerBaseV2.sol](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/VRFConsumerBaseV2.sol)
- [VRFCoordinatorV2Interface.sol](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/VRFCoordinatorV2Interface.sol)
- [LinkTokenInterface.sol](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/LinkTokenInterface.sol)

The contract also includes pre-configured values for the necessary request parameters such as `vrfCoordinator` address, `link` token contract address, and gas lane `keyHash`. You can change these parameters if you want to experiment on different testnets, but for this example you only need to specify `subscriptionId` when you deploy the contract.

Build and deploy the contract on Rinkeby.

1. Open the [VRFv2Consumer.sol](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/VRF/VRFv2Consumer.sol) contract in Remix.

    <div class="remix-callout">
          <a href="https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/VRF/VRFv2Consumer.sol" target="_blank" >Open in Remix</a>
          <a href="/docs/conceptual-overview/#what-is-remix">What is Remix?</a>
    </div>

1. On the **Compile** tab in Remix, compile the `VRFv2Consumer.sol` contract.

1. Configure your deployment. On the **Deploy** tab in Remix, select the **Injected Web3 Environment**, select the `VRFv2Consumer` contract from the contract list, and specify your `subscriptionId` so the constructor can set it.

    ![Example showing the deploy button with the subscriptionID field filled in Remix](/images/vrf/deployWithSubscriptionId.png)

1. Click the **Deploy** button to deploy your contract on-chain. MetaMask opens and asks you to confirm the transaction.

1. After you deploy your contract, copy the address from the **Deployed Contracts** list in Remix. Before you can request randomness from VRF v2, you must add this address as an approved consumer on your subscription account.

    ![Example showing the contract address listed under the Contracts list in Remix](/images/vrf/getContractAddress.png)

1. In the [Subscription Manager](https://vrf.chain.link/), click the ID of your new subscription under the **My Subscriptions** list. The subscription details page opens.

1. Under the **Consumers** section of the Subscription Manager, click **Add consumer**.

1. Enter the address for your consumer contract that you just deployed and click **Add consumer**. MetaMask opens and asks you to confirm the transaction.

Your example contract is deployed and approved to use your subscription balance to pay for VRF v2 requests. Next, [request random values](#request-random-values) from Chainlink VRF.

## Request random values

The deployed contract requests random values from Chainlink VRF, receives those values, and stores them in the `s_randomWords` array. Run the `requestRandomWords()` function on your contract to start the request.

1. Return to Remix and view your deployed contract functions in the **Deployed Contracts** list.

1. Click the `requestRandomWords()` function to send the request for random values to Chainlink VRF. MetaMask opens and asks you to confirm the transaction. After you approve the transaction, Chainlink VRF processes your request. Chainlink VRF fulfills the request and returns the random values to your contract in a callback to the `fulfillRandomWords()` function.

    Depending on current testnet conditions, it might take a few minutes for the callback to return the requested random values to your contract. You can see a list of pending requests for your subscription ID in the [Subscription Manager](https://vrf.chain.link/).

1. After the oracle returns the random values to your contract, the `s_randomWords` variable stores an array with all of the requested random values. Specify the index of the array that you want to display and click `s_randomWords` to print the value. Because this example requests two random values, check the value at index `0` and then check the value at index `1`.

You deployed a simple contract that can request and receive random values from Chainlink VRF. To see more advanced examples where the contract can complete the entire process including subscription setup and management, see the [Example Contracts](/docs/chainlink-vrf/example-contracts/) page.

## Analyzing the contract

In this example, your MetaMask wallet is the subscription owner and you created a consumer contract to use that subscription. The consumer contract uses static configuration parameters.

```solidity
{% include samples/VRF/VRFv2Consumer.sol %}
```

<div class="remix-callout">
      <a href="https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/VRF/VRFv2Consumer.sol" target="_blank" >Open in Remix</a>
      <a href="/docs/conceptual-overview/#what-is-remix">What is Remix?</a>
</div>

The parameters define how your requests will be processed. You can find the values for your network in the [VRF Contract Addresses](/docs/vrf-contracts) page.

- `uint64 s_subscriptionId`: The subscription ID that this contract uses for funding requests.

- `address vrfCoordinator`: The address of the Chainlink VRF Coordinator contract.

- `address link`: The LINK token address for your selected network.

- `bytes32 keyHash`: The gas lane key hash value, which is the maximum gas price you are willing to pay for a request in wei. It functions as an ID of the off-chain VRF job that runs in response to requests.

- `uint32 callbackGasLimit`: The limit for how much gas to use for the callback request to your contract's `fulfillRandomWords()` function. It must be less than the `maxGasLimit` limit on the coordinator contract. In this example, the `fulfillRandomWords()` function stores two random values, which cost about 20,000 gas each, so a limit of 100,000 gas is sufficient. Adjust this value for larger requests depending on how your `fulfillRandomWords()` function processes and stores the received random values. If your `callbackGasLimit` is not sufficient, the callback will fail and your subscription is still charged for the work done to generate your requested random values.

- `uint16 requestConfirmations`: How many confirmations the Chainlink node should wait before responding. The longer the node waits, the more secure the random value is. It must be greater than the `minimumRequestBlockConfirmations` limit on the coordinator contract.

- `uint16 numWords`: How many random values to request. If you can use several random values in a single callback, you can reduce the amount of gas that you spend per random value. The total cost of the callback request depends on how your `fulfillRandomWords()` function processes and stores the received random values, so adjust your `callbackGasLimit` accordingly.

The contract includes the following functions:

- `requestRandomWords()`: Takes your specified parameters and submits the request to the VRF coordinator contract.

- `fulfillRandomWords()`: Receives random values and stores them with your contract.

> Be sure to review your contracts to make sure they follow the best practices on the [security considerations](/docs/vrf-security-considerations/) page.

## Clean up

After you are done with this contract and the subscription, you can retrieve the remaining testnet LINK to use with other examples.

1. In the [Subscription Manager](https://vrf.chain.link/), click the ID of your new subscription under the **My Subscriptions** list. The subscription details page opens.

1. Under your subscription details, click **Cancel subscription**. A field opens asking which wallet address you want to send the remaining funds to.

1. Enter your wallet address and click **Cancel subscription**. MetaMask opens and asks you to confirm the transaction. After you approve the transaction, Chainlink VRF closes your subscription account and sends the remaining LINK to your wallet.
