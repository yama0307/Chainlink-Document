---
With your own Oracle contract, you can use your own node to fulfill requests. This guide will show you how to deploy your own Oracle contract and add jobs to your node so that it can provide data to smart contracts.

## Requirements

Before you begin this guide, complete the following tasks to make sure you have all of the tools that you need:

- Complete the [Beginner Walkthrough](../beginners-tutorial) to obtain Testnet LINK and set up MetaMask.
- Configure an Ethereum client with an active websocket connection. Either [Run an Ethereum Client](../run-an-ethereum-client/) yourself or use an [External Service](../run-an-ethereum-client/#external-services) that your Chainlink Node can access.
- [Run a Chainlink Node](../running-a-chainlink-node/) and connect it to a [supported database](../connecting-to-a-remote-database/).
- Fund the Ethereum address that your Chainlink node uses. You can find the address in the node Operator GUI under the **Keys** tab. The address of the node is the `Regular` type. You can obtain test ETH from several [faucets](../link-token-contracts/).
    - For Chainlink nodes versioned 0.9.6 and earlier, find the Ethereum address in the **Configuration** tab in the `ACCOUNT_ADDRESS` field.

## Address Types

Your node works with several different types of addresses. Each address type has a specific function:
- **Node address:** This is the address for your Chainlink node wallet. The node requires native blockchain tokens at all times to respond to requests. For this example, the node uses ETH. When you start a Chainlink node, it automatically generates this address. You can find this address in the Node's GUI under `ACCOUNT_ADDRESS`.
- **Oracle contract address:** This is the address for contracts like `Operator.sol` or `Oracle.sol` that are deployed to a blockchain. Do not fund these addresses with native blockchain tokens such as ETH. When you make API call requests, the funds pass through this contract to interact with your Chainlink node. This will be the address that smart contract developers point to when they choose a node for an API call. You can find this address in the Node's GUI under `YOUR_ORACLE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`.
- **Admin wallet address:** This is the address that owns your `Operator.sol` or `Oracle.sol` contract addresses. If you're on OCR, this is the wallet address that receives LINK tokens.

## Deploy your own Oracle contract

1. Go to Remix and [open the `Oracle.sol` smart contract](https://remix.ethereum.org/#optimize=true&version=soljson-v0.4.24+commit.e67f0147.js&url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/NodeOperators/Oracle.sol).

    ![The Remix file explorer showing Oracle.sol.](/files/05f12f3-00eeef4-remix001.jpg)

1. Click the `Oracle.sol` file. The contents of this file will be very minimal.

1. On the **Compile** tab, click the **Compile** button for `Oracle.sol`. Remix automatically selects the compiler version and language from the `pragma` line unless you select a specific version manually.

    ![The Compile tab showing the Compile button.](/files/6aa5936-remix002.jpg)

1. On the **Deploy and Run** tab, configure the following settings:

    - Select "Injected Web3" as your **Environment**. The Javascript VM environment cannot access your oracle node.
    - Select the "Oracle" contract from the **Contract** menu.
    - Copy the address for the network you are using and paste it into the `address_link` field next to the **Deploy** button. Use one of the following network addresses:

      ``` text Rinkeby
      0x01BE23585060835E02B77ef475b0Cc51aA1e0709
      ```
      ``` text Kovan
      0xa36085F69e2889c224210F603D836748e7dC0088
      ```
      ``` text Mainnet
      0x514910771AF9Ca656af840dff83E8264EcF986CA
      ```

    ![The Deploy & Run transaction window showing Injected Web 3 selected and the address for your MetaMask wallet.](/files/b9d3620-remix004.jpg)

1. Click **Deploy**. MetaMask prompts you to confirm the transaction.

    > ðŸš§ MetaMask doesn't pop up?
    >
    > If MetaMask does not prompt you and instead displays the error below, disable "Privacy Mode" in MetaMask. You can do this by clicking on your unique account icon at the top-right, then go to the Settings. Privacy Mode will be a switch near the bottom.
    >
    > Error: **Send transaction failed: Invalid address. If you use an injected provider, please check it is properly unlocked.**

1. After you deploy the contract, a link to Etherscan displays at the bottom. Open that link in a new tab to keep track of the transaction.

    ![Remix Pending Transaction Message](/files/b6fe1ac-remix005.jpg)

1. If the transaction is successful, a new address displays in the **Deployed Contracts** section.

    ![Screenshot showing the newly deployed contract.](/files/6858cf3-remix006.jpg)

1. Keep note of the Oracle contract address. You need it later for your consuming contract.

## Add your node to the Oracle contract

Find the address for your Chainlink node and add it to the Oracle contract.

1. In the Chainlink Operator GUI for your node, find and copy the node address:

    - **Version 0.9.7 and newer:** Find the address at the bottom of the **Keys** page in the Account addresses section.
      ![Node UI Account Addresses](/images/node-operators/node-address.png)

    - **Version 0.9.6 and earlier:** Find the address on the **Configurations** page.
      ![Node UI Configuration Account Address](/files/d2e5225-Screenshot_from_2018-12-17_08-23-16.png)

1. In Remix, call the `setFulfillmentPermission` function with the address of your node, a comma, and the value `true`, as the input parameters. This allows your node to fulfill requests to your oracle contract.

    ![A screenshot showing all of the fields for the deployed contract in Remix.](/files/c6925db-remix007.jpg)

1. Click the `setFulfillmentPermission` function to run it. Approve the transaction in MetaMask and wait for it to confirm on the blockchain.

## Add jobs to the node

You can add jobs to your Chainlink node in the Chainlink Operator GUI. Use the example [Job Specifications](../job-specifications/) below.

If using Chainlink version `0.9.4` or above, you can add a `name` to your job spec.

```json Bytes32 (GET)
{
  "name": "Get > Bytes32",
  "initiators": [
    {
      "type": "runlog",
      "params": {
        "address": "YOUR_ORACLE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS"
      }
    }
  ],
  "tasks": [
    {
      "type": "httpget"
    },
    {
      "type": "jsonparse"
    },
    {
      "type": "ethbytes32"
    },
    {
      "type": "ethtx"
    }
  ]
}
```
```json Bytes32 (POST)
{
  "name": "POST > Bytes32",
  "initiators": [
    {
      "type": "runlog",
      "params": {
        "address": "YOUR_ORACLE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS"
      }
    }
  ],
  "tasks": [
    {
      "type": "httpget"
    },
    {
      "type": "jsonparse"
    },
    {
      "type": "ethbytes32"
    },
    {
      "type": "ethtx"
    }
  ]
}
```
```json Int256
{
  "name": "Get > Int256",
  "initiators": [
    {
      "type": "runlog",
      "params": {
        "address": "YOUR_ORACLE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS"
      }
    }
  ],
  "tasks": [
    {
      "type": "httpget"
    },
    {
      "type": "jsonparse"
    },
    {
      "type": "multiply"
    },
    {
      "type": "ethint256"
    },
    {
      "type": "ethtx"
    }
  ]
}
```
```json Uint256
{
  "name": "Get > Uint256",
  "initiators": [
    {
      "type": "runlog",
      "params": {
        "address": "YOUR_ORACLE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS"
      }
    }
  ],
  "tasks": [
    {
      "type": "httpget"
    },
    {
      "type": "jsonparse"
    },
    {
      "type": "multiply"
    },
    {
      "type": "ethuint256"
    },
    {
      "type": "ethtx"
    }
  ]
}
```
```json Bool
{
  "name": "Get > Bool",
  "initiators": [
    {
      "type": "runlog",
      "params": {
        "address": "YOUR_ORACLE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS"
      }
    }
  ],
  "tasks": [
    {
      "type": "httpget"
    },
    {
      "type": "jsonparse"
    },
    {
      "type": "ethbool"
    },
    {
      "type": "ethtx"
    }
  ]
}
```
1. In the Chainlink Operator GUI on the **Jobs** tab, click **New Job**.

    ![The new job button.](/files/25bb51c-Screenshot_from_2018-11-02_08-30-26.png)

1. Paste the job specification from above into the text field.

    ![The new job page with JSON for a new job pasted.](/files/ee412d6-Screenshot_from_2018-12-15_08-30-43.png)

1. Replace `YOUR_ORACLE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` with the address of your deployed oracle contract address from the previous steps. This address is different than the `ACCOUNT_ADDRESS` from your Chainlink node.

1. Click **Create Job**. If the node creates the job successfully, a notice with the job ID appears. Take note of this job ID. You need it later.

    ![A screenshot showing that the job is created successfully.](/files/a7a2f0c-Screenshot_from_2018-11-02_08-42-22.png)

1. Repeat this process for each of the remaining jobs above until all of the jobs are added.

The address for each job auto-populates with the zero-address. This means the Chainlink node will listen to your job ID from any address. You can also specify an address in the `params` object of the `RunLog` initiator for your oracle contract.

## Create a request to your node

> ðŸ“˜ If you're going through this guide on Ethereum mainnet, the `TestnetConsumer.sol` contract will still work. However, understand that you're sending real LINK to yourself. **Be sure to practice on the test networks multiple times before attempting to run a node on mainnet.**

After you add jobs to your node, you can use the node to fulfill requests. This section shows what requesters do when they send requests to your node. It is also a way to test and make sure that your node is functioning correctly.

1. Open [TestnetConsumer.sol in Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/APIRequests/ATestnetConsumer.sol).

1. On the **Compiler** tab, click the **Compile** button for `TestnetConsumer.sol`.

    ![Screenshot of TestnetConsumer.sol with the compile button.](/files/a8a5ecd-Screenshot_from_2019-05-16_15-39-05.png)

1. On the **Deploy and Run** tab, configure the following settings:

    - Select "Injected Web3" as your environment.
    - Select "ATestnetConsumer" from the **Contract** menu.
    - Copy the address for the network you are using and paste it into the `address_link` field next to the **Deploy** button.

1. Click **Deploy**. MetaMask prompts you to confirm the transaction.

1. Fund the contract by sending LINK to the contract's address. See the [Fund your contract](../fund-your-contract/) page for instructions. The address for the `ATestnetConsumer` contract is on the list of your deployed contracts in Remix.

1. After you fund the contract, create a request. Input your oracle contract address and the job ID for the `Get > Uint256` job into the `requestEthereumPrice` request method. Separate the contract address and the job ID by a comma.

    ![Screenshot of the requestEthereumPrice field with an address filled in.](/files/dfce3b0-Screenshot_from_2019-05-16_17-12-51.png)

1. Click the request method button and you should see your node log the request coming in and its fulfillment. After the transaction from the node is confirmed, you should see the value updated on your contract by clicking on the `currentPrice` button.

    ![A screenshot of the currentPrice button](/files/6741635-Screenshot_from_2019-05-15_15-38-25.png)

## Withdrawing LINK

You can withdraw LINK from the Oracle contract. In Remix under the list of deployed contracts, click on your Oracle contract and find the `withdraw` function in the function list. Note that the testnet consumer contract also has a `withdraw` function that is different.

![Remix Click Withdraw Button](/files/f8ffdc0-c6925db-remix007.jpg)

Paste the address you want to withdraw to, and specify the amount of LINK that you want to withdraw. Then, click `withdraw`. Confirm the transaction in MetaMask when the popup appears.
