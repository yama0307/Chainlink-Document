# Polkadot and Substrate Resources

Welcome to Polkadot and Substrate! The following sections list a few of the most important and useful resources that you might need to successfully develop at the intersection between Polkadot, Substrate and ChainLink. 


## What is Polkadot?

Polkadot is a sharded, multichain network founded by Dr. Gavin Wood, the co-founder and former chief technology officer of Ethereum and creator of the Solidity programming language. The Polkadot network is a metaprotocol that solves many challenges that have hindered the growth of legacy blockchains, including scalability, governance, security, and interoperability. Polkadot is a blockchain network fostered by the Web3 Foundation and built by industry-leading developers at Parity Technologies.


## What is Substrate?

Blockchains in the Polkadot ecosystem are built using Substrate. Substrate is a blockchain development framework with a completely generic state transition function and modular components for consensus, networking, and configuration. Despite being "completely generic", it comes with both standards and conventions, particularly with the Substrate runtime module library (FRAME). FRAME makes rapid development of purpose-built blockchains a reality by providing developers with a flexible library of carefully designed blockchain building blocks. Cumulus (under development), a tool for easily connecting your blockchain to a network of blockchains, unlocks interchain communication, collaboration and shared security on the Polkadot network.
