## Overview

[Solana](https://solana.com/) supports on-chain programs in the [Rust](https://docs.solana.com/developing/on-chain-programs/developing-rust) or [C](https://docs.solana.com/developing/on-chain-programs/developing-c) languages. Chainlinkâ€™s Solana deployment has no dependencies on external blockchain networks such as Ethereum. To learn more about the Solana programming model, see the [Solana Documentation](https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/overview).

In Solana, storage and smart contract logic are separate. Programs store all the logic similar to an EVM smart contract. The accounts store all the data. Solana programs are stateless, so you don't always need to deploy your program to the network to test it. Compared to Solidity, the combination of an account and a program is equivalent to a smart contract on an EVM chain. State and logic are separate in Solana.

## Available services

The following Chainlink services are available on the Solana network:

- [Solana Devnet](https://solscan.io/?cluster=devnet):
  - [Data Feeds](/docs/solana/using-data-feeds-solana/)
