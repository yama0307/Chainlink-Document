The most common use case for Data Feeds is to [Get the Latest Price](../get-the-latest-price/). However, <a href="https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/master/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer, noopener">`AggregatorV3Interface`</a> also exposes functions which can be used to retrieve price data of a previous round ID.

There are two parameters that can cause Chainlink nodes to update:

| Name                   | Description                                                          |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  Deviation Threshold     | Chainlink nodes are monitoring prices of assets off-chain. The deviation of the real-world price of an asset beyond a certain interval triggers all the nodes to update.                  |
|  Heartbeat Threshold | If the price stays within the deviation parameters, it will only trigger an update every *X* minutes / hours. |


You can find these parameters at [data.chain.link](https://data.chain.link/) on an example like [ETH / USD](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/crypto-usd/eth-usd).

To learn how data feeds update, see the [Decentralized Data Model](../architecture-decentralized-model/#aggregator) page.

## Historical Rounds

As shown in the [decentralized model](/docs/architecture-decentralized-model/), the consumer contracts call the proxy contract, which abstracts the underlying aggregator contract. The main advantage is to enable upgrades of the aggregator without impacting the consumer contracts. That also means that historical data can can be stored in different aggregators.
As show in the following sequence diagram, to get historical data, call the `getRoundData` [function](/docs/price-feeds-api-reference/#getrounddata) function and provide `roundId` as a parameter.
![getRoundData Sequence Diagram](/images/data-feed/getRoundData-sequence.png)

Note that roundIds have different meanings in proxy contracts and in aggregator contracts.

### `roundId` in Aggregator (aggregatorRoundId)

Oracles provide periodic data updates to the aggregators. Data feeds are updated in **rounds**. Rounds are identified by their `roundId`, which increases with each new round. This increase may not be monotonic. Knowing the `roundId` of a previous round allows contracts to consume historical price data.

The examples in this document name the aggregator `roundId` as `aggregatorRoundId` to differentiate it from the proxy `roundId`.


### `roundId` in Proxy

Because a proxy has references to current and all previous underlying aggregators, it needs a way to fetch data from the correct aggregator. The `roundId` is computed in the [proxy contract](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.7/dev/AggregatorProxy.sol) as shown in the following example:

```solidity
roundId = uint80((uint256(phaseId) << 64) | aggregatorRoundId);
```

where:

- `phaseId` is incremented each time the underlying aggregator implementation is updated. It is used as key to find the aggregator address. 
- `aggregatorRoundId` is the aggregator `roundId`. The id starts at 1.
- `roundId` is the computed round id. From the above formula, you can think of it as a large number containing the `phaseId` and the `aggregatorRoundId`.

> ðŸ“˜ Note
>
> The example formula above ensures that no matter how many times the underlying aggregator changes, the proxy `roundId` will always increase.

** Example:**

When you query historical data, it is important to know when you reach the end of the history of the underlying aggregator. As an example, if the `latestRoundData` [function](/docs/price-feeds-api-reference/#latestrounddata) of the [LINK / USD feed on Ethereum Mainnet](/docs/ethereum-addresses/) returns `roundId = 92233720368547771158`, you can use this value to compute the `phaseId` and `aggregatorRoundId`:

- `phaseId = 92233720368547771158 >> 64`: Right shifting an integer by 64 bits is equivalent to dividing it by 2^64: `phaseId = 92233720368547771158/ 2^64 = 5`. The current phase id is 5 , which means that this proxy has had 5 underlying aggregators since its initial deployment.
- `aggregatorRoundId = uint64(92233720368547771158)`: This retrieves the first 64 bits from the right. To calculate this off-chain, you can use the following JavaScript example:

```javascript
// First parse to BigInt to perform computation with big integers
const num = BigInt("92233720368547771158");
const num2 = BigInt("0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF"); // Largest 64bits integer 

console.log(Number(num >> 64n)); // returns 5 (phaseId)
console.log(Number(num & num2)) // returns 13078 (aggregatorRoundId) . Use & (AND bitwise operator) which sets each bit to _1_ if both bits are _1_
```

Using _13078_ as the current aggregator's round, get its historical data by looping over the [`getRoundData` function](/docs/price-feeds-api-reference/#getrounddata):
- Start from the first round: _92233720368547758081_ (result of _92233720368547771158 - 13078 + 1_)
- Continue until the current round: _92233720368547771158_

To get the historical data for previous aggregators, decrement the `phaseId` and start from round _1_. For phase _4_, get the starting `roundId` off-chain using the following JavaScript example: 

```javascript
const phaseId = BigInt("4");
const aggregatorRoundId = BigInt("1");

roundId = (phaseId << 64n) | aggregatorRoundId // returns 73786976294838206465n
```

Loop over the [`getRoundData` function](/docs/price-feeds-api-reference/#getrounddata). Start at _73786976294838206465_ and increment it until you get a revert. This means that you reached the last round for the underlying aggregator. The same process could be repeated for previous `phaseIds` (3,2,1).

> ðŸš§ Looping on-chain
>
> The examples showed how to loop off-chain to fetch all historical data from a given proxy. You could also write a similar code on-chain, but be aware that this could cause **very high gas prices** if a state is changed within the same function.


### `getRoundData` return values

The [`getRoundData` function](/docs/price-feeds-api-reference/#getrounddata) returns the following values:

- `roundId`: The combination of `aggregatorRoundId` and `phaseId` (see explanation above). The `roundId` can jump significantly when the `phaseId` is updated.
- `answer` is the price.
- `answeredInRound`: The combination of `aggregatorAnsweredInRound` and `phaseId`. `aggregatorAnsweredInRound`: The round the answer was updated in. You can check `answeredInRound` against the current `roundId`. If `answeredInRound` is less than `roundId`, the answer is being carried over. If `answeredInRound` is equal to `roundId`, then the answer is fresh.
- `startedAt`: The timestamp when the round started.
- `updatedAt`: The timestamp when the answer was computed. 

> ðŸš§ Important
>
> A read can revert if the caller is requesting the details of a round that was invalid or has not yet been answered. If you are deriving a round ID without having observed it before, the round might not be complete. To check the round, validate that the timestamp on that round is not 0.
> In a best-case scenario, rounds update chronologically. However, a round can time out if it doesn't reach consensus. Technically, that is a timed out round that carries over the answer from the previous round.
