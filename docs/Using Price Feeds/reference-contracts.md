Chainlink Data Feed contracts are updated on a regular basis by multiple Chainlink nodes. For implementation details, read [Introduction to Data Feeds](../using-chainlink-reference-contracts/). Chainlink is a blockchain agnostic technology. This page lists the blockchain networks that Chainlink Data Feeds are currently live on, and the details of where to access them.

## Chainlink Labs price feed categories

Our categorization is put in place to better inform our users of the intended use cases of feeds and help to highlight some of the inherent market risks surrounding the data quality of these feeds.

All feeds published on [docs.chain.link](http://docs.chain.link) are monitored and maintained to the same levels and standards, each feed goes through a rigorous assessment process when implemented. The assessment criteria can change depending on the product type of feed being deployed.

Feeds do though evolve over time and we regularly monitor their market fundamentals and will proactively communicate any upcoming changes or issues we identify with a feed, these categories are designed to act as a mechanism in order to assist in accomplishing that task.

Data feeds are grouped into the following categories:

ðŸŸ¢ Verified
ðŸŸ¡ Monitored
ðŸ”µ Custom
âš« Specialized

For more information on these categories, see the [Selecting Quality Data Feeds](/docs/selecting-data-feeds/#data-feed-categories) page.
