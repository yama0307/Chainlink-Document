![Feed Registry](/files/feed-registry.png)

The Chainlink Feed Registry is an on-chain mapping of assets to feeds. It enables you to query Chainlink price feeds from asset addresses directly, without needing to know the feed contract addresses. They enable smart contracts to retrieve the latest price of an asset in a single call, from a single contract.

# Base and Quote

The Feed Registry maps feeds using `base` and `quote` address pairs as keys. The Feed Registry fully supports the [`AggregatorV3Interface`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol) API, but with additional `base` and `quote` inputs to support multiple pairs and feeds on a single contract. 

To get the latest LINK / USD round data from the registry, call: 

```solidity Mainnet
latestRoundData(address base, address quote)
```

For example, to get the latest LINK / USD price:

- `base`: The LINK token address on that network e.g. `0x514910771AF9Ca656af840dff83E8264EcF986CA` for LINK on Ethereum mainnet
- `quote`: A `Denominations.USD` address (`0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000348`), which is based on [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).

```solidity Mainnet
latestRoundData(0x514910771AF9Ca656af840dff83E8264EcF986CA, 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000348)
```
```solidity Kovan
latestRoundData(0xa36085f69e2889c224210f603d836748e7dc0088, 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000348)
```

To get the latest LINK / ETH price on Ethereum:

- `base`: The LINK token address on that network e.g. `0x514910771AF9Ca656af840dff83E8264EcF986CA` for LINK on Ethereum mainnet
- `quote`: A `Denominations.ETH` address (`0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE`)

```solidity Mainnet
latestRoundData(0x514910771AF9Ca656af840dff83E8264EcF986CA, 0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE)
```
```solidity Kovan
latestRoundData(0xa36085f69e2889c224210f603d836748e7dc0088, 0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE)
```

## Denominations library

A [`Denominations`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/Denominations.sol) Solidity library is available for you to fetch currency identifiers which lack a canonical Ethereum address:


```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

library Denominations {
  address public constant ETH = 0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE;
  address public constant BTC = 0xbBbBBBBbbBBBbbbBbbBbbbbBBbBbbbbBbBbbBBbB;

  // Fiat currencies follow https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217
  address public constant USD = address(840);
  address public constant GBP = address(826);
  address public constant EUR = address(978);
  
  // ... other fiat currencies
}
```

Import and use the library in your contract as follows:

```solidity
import "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/Denominations.sol";

latestRoundData(Denominations.ETH, Denominations.USD);
```

Please be aware that fiat currency addresses are *hexadecimal* values of ISO 4217 codes. For example, in the case of USD which has ISO 4217 code of 840:

```
address public constant USD = address(840); // "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000348" in hex
```

# Code Examples

## Solidity

To consume price data from the Feed Registry, your smart contract should reference [`FeedRegistryInterface`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/FeedRegistryInterface.sol), which defines the external functions implemented by the Feed Registry.

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.6;

import "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/FeedRegistryInterface.sol";
import "@chainlink/contracts/src/v0.8/Denominations.sol";

contract PriceConsumer {
    FeedRegistryInterface internal registry;

    /**
     * Network: Ethereum Kovan
     * Feed Registry: 0xAa7F6f7f507457a1EE157fE97F6c7DB2BEec5cD0
     */
    constructor(address _registry) {
        registry = FeedRegistryInterface(_registry);
    }

    /**
     * Returns the ETH / USD price
     */
    function getEthUsdPrice() public view returns (int) {
        (
            uint80 roundID,
            int price,
            uint startedAt,
            uint timeStamp,
            uint80 answeredInRound
        ) = registry.latestRoundData(Denominations.ETH, Denominations.USD);
        return price;
    }

    /**
     * Returns the latest price
     */
    function getPrice(address base, address quote) public view returns (int) {
        (
            uint80 roundID, 
            int price,
            uint startedAt,
            uint timeStamp,
            uint80 answeredInRound
        ) = registry.latestRoundData(base, quote);
        return price;
    }
}
```

function version(address base, address quote) external view returns (uint256)
```

### Parameters

* `base`: The base asset address.
* `quote`: The quote asset address.

### Return Values

* `RETURN`: The version number.

## getFeed

Returns the primary aggregator address of a base / quote pair. Note that on-chain contracts cannot read from aggregators directly, only through Feed Registry or Proxy contracts.

```solidity
function getFeed(
    address base,
    address quote
  )
    external
    view
    returns (
      AggregatorV2V3Interface aggregator
    );
```

### Parameters

* `base`: The base asset address.
* `quote`: The quote asset address.

### Return Values

* `aggregator`: The primary aggregator address.

## getPhaseFeed

Returns the underlying aggregator address of a base / quote pair at a specified phase. Note that on-chain contracts cannot read from aggregators directly, only through Feed Registry or Proxy contracts. 
Phase ids start at `1`. You can get the current Phase by calling `getCurrentPhaseId()`.

```solidity
function getPhaseFeed(
    address base,
    address quote,
    uint16 phaseId
  )
    external
    view
    returns (
      AggregatorV2V3Interface aggregator
    );
```

### Parameters

* `base`: The base asset address.
* `quote`: The quote asset address.
* `phaseId`: The phase id.

### Return Values

* `aggregator`: The primary aggregator address at the specified phase.

## isFeedEnabled

Returns true if an aggregator is enabled as primary on the feed registry. This is useful to check if you should index events from an aggregator contract, because you want to only index events of primary aggregators.

```solidity
function isFeedEnabled(
    address aggregator
  )
    external
    view
    returns (
      bool
    );
```

### Parameters

* `aggregator`: The aggregator address

### Return Values

* `RETURN`: `true` if the supplied aggregator is a primary aggregator for any base / quote pair.

## getPhase

Returns the starting and ending aggregator round ids of a base / quote pair. 

```solidity
function getPhase(
    address base,
    address quote,
    uint16 phaseId
  )
    external
    view
    returns (
      Phase memory phase
    );
```

Phases hold the following information:

```solidity
struct Phase {
    uint16 phaseId;
    uint80 startingAggregatorRoundId;
    uint80 endingAggregatorRoundId;
}
```

### Parameters

* `base`: The base asset address.
* `quote`: The quote asset address.
* `phaseId`: The phase id.

### Return Values

* `RETURN`: `Phase` details of a base / quote pair.

## getRoundFeed

Returns the underlying aggregator address of a base / quote pair at a specified round. Note that on-chain contracts cannot read from aggregators directly, only through Feed Registry or Proxy contracts.

```solidity
  function getRoundFeed(
    address base,
    address quote,
    uint80 roundId
  )
    external
    view
    returns (
      AggregatorV2V3Interface aggregator
    );
```

### Parameters

* `base`: The base asset address.
* `quote`: The quote asset address.
* `roundId`: The round id.

### Return Values

* `aggregator`: The underlying aggregator address of a base / quote pair at the specified round.

## getPhaseRange

Returns the starting and ending round ids of a base / quote pair at a specified phase. 

Please note that this `roundId` is calculated from the phase id and the underlying aggregator's round id. To get the raw aggregator round ids of a phase for indexing purposes, please use `getPhase()`.

```solidity
  function getPhaseRange(
    address base,
    address quote,
    uint16 phaseId
  )
    external
    view
    returns (
      uint80 startingRoundId,
      uint80 endingRoundId
    );
```

### Parameters

* `base`: The base asset address.
* `quote`: The quote asset address.
* `phaseId`: The phase id.

### Return Values

* `startingRoundId`: The starting round id
* `endingRoundId`: The ending round id

## getPreviousRoundId

Returns the previous round id of a base / quote pair given a specified round. Note that rounds are non-monotonic across phases.

```solidity
  function getPreviousRoundId(
