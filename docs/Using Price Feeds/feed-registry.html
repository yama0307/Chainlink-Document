![Feed Registry](/files/feed-registry.png)

The Chainlink Feed Registry is an on-chain mapping of assets to feeds. It enables you to query Chainlink price feeds from a pair of asset and denomination addresses directly, without needing to know the feed contract addresses. They enable smart contracts to retrieve the latest price of an asset in a single call, from a single contract.

# Assets and Denominations

The Feed Registry maps feeds using `asset` and `denomination` address pairs as keys. The Feed Registry fully supports the <a href="https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol" target="_blank">`AggregatorV3Interface`</a> API, but with additional `asset` and `denomination` inputs to support multiple pairs and feeds. To get the latest LINK / USD round data from the registry, you call: 

```solidity Mainnet
latestRoundData(address assset, address denomination)
```

For example, to get the latest LINK / USD price:

- `asset`: The LINK token address on that network e.g. `0x514910771AF9Ca656af840dff83E8264EcF986CA` for LINK on Ethereum mainnet
- `denomination`: A `Denominations.USD` address (`0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000348`), which is based on [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).

```solidity Mainnet
latestRoundData(0x514910771AF9Ca656af840dff83E8264EcF986CA, 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000348)
```
```solidity Kovan
latestRoundData(0xa36085f69e2889c224210f603d836748e7dc0088, 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000348)
```

To get the latest LINK / ETH price on Ethereum:

- `asset`: The LINK token address on that network e.g. `0x514910771AF9Ca656af840dff83E8264EcF986CA` for LINK on Ethereum mainnet
- `denomination`: A `Denominations.ETH` address (`0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE`)

```solidity Mainnet
latestRoundData(0x514910771AF9Ca656af840dff83E8264EcF986CA, 0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE)
```
```solidity Kovan
latestRoundData(0xa36085f69e2889c224210f603d836748e7dc0088, 0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE)
```

## Denominations library

A <a href="https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/dev/Denominations.sol" target="_blank">`Denominations`</a> Solidity library is available for you to query common denominations:


```javascript Solidity 8
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

library Denominations {
  address public constant ETH = 0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE;
  address public constant BTC = 0xbBbBBBBbbBBBbbbBbbBbbbbBBbBbbbbBbBbbBBbB;

  // Fiat currencies follow https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217
  address public constant USD = address(840);
  address public constant GBP = address(826);
  address public constant EUR = address(978);
  address public constant JPY = address(392);
  address public constant KRW = address(410);
  address public constant CNY = address(156);
  address public constant AUD = address(36);
  address public constant CAD = address(124);
  address public constant CHF = address(756);
  address public constant ARS = address(32);
}
```
```javascript Solidity 7
pragma solidity ^0.7.0;

  address public constant AUD = address(36);
  address public constant CAD = address(124);
  address public constant CHF = address(756);

}
```
```javascript Solidity 6

  address public constant BTC = 0xbBbBBBBbbBBBbbbBbbBbbbbBBbBbbbbBbBbbBBbB;

# Code Examples
