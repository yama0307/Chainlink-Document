Chainlink Data Feeds are the quickest way to connect your smart contracts to the real-world market prices of assets. For example, one use for data feeds is to enable smart contracts to retrieve the latest pricing data of an asset in a single call.

This guide applies specifically to using data feeds on EVM Chains. To get the full list of Chainlink Data Feeds running on the EVM Chains, see the [Reference Contracts](/docs/reference-contracts/) page.

{% include 'data-quality.md' %}

You can use smart contracts to get asset prices on EVM Chains. These examples show you how to get the price of Ethereum (ETH) on the Ethereum network, but you can modify the examples to work on other EVM Chains as well. The list of data feeds for each network are available on the [Data Feed Contracts](../reference-contracts/) page. For development, use testnet data feeds such as the [ETH/USD Feed](https://kovan.etherscan.io/address/0x9326BFA02ADD2366b30bacB125260Af641031331) on the Kovan testnet.

> ðŸ“˜ New Feed Registry
> You can use the [Feed Registry](../feed-registry/) to reference data feed assets by name or currency identifier instead of by pair/proxy address.

You can write smart contracts that consume data feeds using several languages, but this guide shows you the following examples:

- [Solidity](#solidity)
- [Javascript](#javascript) with [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/)
- [Python](#python) with [Web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

## Solidity

To consume price data, your smart contract should reference [`AggregatorV3Interface`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/master/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol), which defines the external functions implemented by Data Feeds.

```solidity Kovan
{% include 'samples/PriceFeeds/PriceConsumerV3.sol' %}
```

<div class="remix-callout">
      <a href="https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/PriceFeeds/PriceConsumerV3.sol" target="_blank" >Open in Remix</a>
      <a href="/docs/conceptual-overview/#what-is-remix">What is Remix?</a>
</div>

The `latestRoundData` function returns five values representing information about the latest price data. See the [Data Feeds API Reference](../price-feeds-api-reference/) for more details.

## Javascript

This example uses [web3.js](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/) to retrieve feed data from the [ETH / USD feed](https://kovan.etherscan.io/address/0x9326BFA02ADD2366b30bacB125260Af641031331) on the Ethereum network.

```javascript web3.js
{% include 'samples/PriceFeeds/PriceConsumerV3.js' %}
```
```javascript ethers.js
{% include 'samples/PriceFeeds/PriceConsumerV3Ethers.js' %}
```

## Python

This example uses [Web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to retrieve feed data from the [ETH / USD feed](https://kovan.etherscan.io/address/0x9326BFA02ADD2366b30bacB125260Af641031331) on the Ethereum network.

```python Kovan
{% include 'samples/PriceFeeds/PriceConsumerV3.py' %}
```

<div class="row cl-button-container">
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-12">
    <a href="https://repl.it/@alexroan/GetLatestPriceWeb3PY" class="cl-button--ghost python-tracked">Run this Python example</a>
    </div>
</div>

## Getting a different price denomination

Chainlink Data Feeds can be used in combination to derive denominated price pairs in other currencies.

If you require a denomination other than what is provided, you can use two data feeds to derive the pair that you need. For example, if you needed a BTC / EUR price, you could take the BTC / USD feed and the EUR / USD feed and derive BTC / EUR using division.

> ðŸš§ Important
>
> If your contracts require Solidity versions that are `>=0.6.0 <0.8.0`, use [OpenZeppelin's SafeMath version 3.4](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/release-v3.4/contracts/math/SafeMath.sol).

```solidity
{% include 'samples/PriceFeeds/PriceConverter.sol' %}
```

<div class="remix-callout">
      <a href="https://remix.ethereum.org/#url=https://docs.chain.link/samples/PriceFeeds/PriceConverter.sol" target="_blank" >Open in Remix</a>
      <a href="/docs/conceptual-overview/#what-is-remix">What is Remix?</a>
</div>

## How Do Data Feeds Get Their Data?

Data Feeds are aggregated from many data sources by a decentralized set of independent Node Operators. The [Decentralized Data Model](../architecture-decentralized-model/) describes this in detail.

## More Aggregator Functions

Getting the latest price is not the only data that aggregators can retrieve. You can also retrieve historical price data. To learn more, see the [Historical Price Data](../historical-price-data/) page.

To understand different use cases for Chainlink Price Feeds, refer to [Other Tutorials](/docs/other-tutorials/).
