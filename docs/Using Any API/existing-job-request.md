## Overview

Using an *existing* Oracle Job makes your smart contract code more succinct. This page explains how to retrieve the winners of various elections based on the date, state, and race ID.

## AP Election Data Consumer

In [Make a GET Request](../make-a-http-get-request/), the example contract code declared which URL to use, where to find the data in the response, and how to convert it so that it can be represented on-chain.

This example uses an existing job that is pre-configured to make requests to get [AP Election data](https://developer.ap.org/ap-elections-api/).

You can find the job spec for this example on [GitHub](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/documentation/tree/main/_includes/samples/APIRequests/ap-election-job.toml).


>❗️ Remember to fund your contract with LINK!
>
> Making a job request will fail unless your deployed contract has enough LINK to pay for it. **Learn how to [Acquire testnet LINK](../acquire-link/) and [Fund your contract](../fund-your-contract/)**.
