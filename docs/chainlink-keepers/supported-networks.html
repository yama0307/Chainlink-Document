### {{network[0]}}


* **Payment Premium (paymentPremiumPPB):** <span id="show-{{network[1]}}-paymentPremiumPPB"></span>% gas premium
    This premium is applied on top of the gas cost paid by the Keeper to perform your Upkeep
* **Block Count Per Turn (blockCountPerTurn):** <span id="show-{{network[1]}}-blockCountPerTurn"></span>
    The number of blocks in each turn before the Upkeep is rotated to the next Keeper
* **Check Gas Limit (checkGasLimit):** <span id="show-{{network[1]}}-checkGasLimit"></span>
    The maximum amount of gas that can be used by your checkUpkeep for off-chain computation.
* **Call Gas Limit (callGasLimit):** <span>5,000,000</span> <!-- @TODO render this programatically. <span id="show-callGasLimit"></span> -->
    The maximum amount of gas that can be used by the client contract’s performUpkeep for the on-chain transaction. You can set an upper limit on your Upkeep during registration, but this number must not exceed the call gas limit on the KeeperRegistry.
* **Gas Ceiling Multiplier (gasCeilingMultiplier):** <span id="show-{{network[1]}}-gasCeilingMultiplier"></span>
    Establishes a ceiling for the maximum price based on the on-chain fast gas feed.
