## Overview
This guide explains the use case for the [`EthBalanceMonitor` contract](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/upkeeps/EthBalanceMonitor.sol). This Keeper contract monitors and funds Ethereum addresses that developers might need to top up frequently based on a configurable threshold. As a result, nodes are funded automatically.

After deploying the contract, developers can go to [keepers.chain.link](https://keepers.chain.link/) to register Upkeep and run the contract. To take full advantage of the Keepers automation infrastructure, read all of the documentation to understand the features of Chainlink Keepers.

## `EthBalanceMonitor` Properties
`EthBalanceMonitor` is ownable, pausable, and Keepers-compatible:

- **Ownable**: The contract has an owner address, and provides basic authorization control functions. This simplifies the implementation of *user permissions* and allows for transer of ownership.
- **Pausable**: This feature allows the contract to implement a pause and unpause mechanism that the contract owner can trigger.
- **Keepers-compatible**: The `KeeperCompatibleInterface` is necessary to create Keepers-compatible contracts. To learn more about the `KeeperCompatibleInterface` and its uses and functions, refer to [Making Keepers-compatible Contracts](../compatible-contracts/).

You can open the contract in Remix:

> ⚠️ Note on Owner Settings
>
> Aside from certain features listed below, only owners can withdraw funds and pause or unpause the contract. If the contract is paused or unpaused, it will affect `checkUpkeep`, `performUpkeep`, and `topUp` functions.

## Functions
Functions with an asterisk (`*`) denote features that only the owner can change. Click on each function to learn more about its parameters and design patterns:

| Function Name                   | Description                                                          |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  [`setWatchList`*](#setwatchlist-function)   | Addresses to watch minimum balance and how much to top it up.                     |
|  [`setKeeperRegistryAddress`*](#setkeeperregistryaddress-function) | Updates the `KeeperRegistry` address. |
|  [`setMinWaitPeriodSeconds`*](#setminwaitperiodseconds-function)    | Updates the global minimum period between top ups. |
|  [`topUp`](#topup-function)   | Used by `performUpkeep`. This function will only trigger top up if conditions are met.  |

Below are the feed functions in `EthBalanceMonitor`:

| Read Function Name                   | Description                                                          |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  `getUnderfundedAddresses`    | View function used in `checkUpkeep` to find underfunded balances.                    |
|  `getKeeperRegistryAddress` | Views the `KeeperRegistry` address. |
|  `getMinWaitPeriodSeconds`    | Views the global minimum period between top ups. |
|  `getWatchList`    | Views addresses to watch minimum balance and how much to top it up.  |
|  `getAccountInfo`    | Provides information about the specific target address, including the last time it was topped up. This function is *external only*.  |

### `setWatchList` Function

#### Parameters
| Name                            | Description                                                  | Suggested Setting              |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `addresses`                    | The list of addresses to watch | (not applicable) |
| `minBalancesWei`                 | The minimum balances for each address | 5000000000000000000 (5 ETH)|
| `topUpAmountsWei`                 | The amount to top up each address | 5000000000000000000 (5 ETH)|

Only the owner can `setWatchList`. Each of the parameters should be set with distinct requirements for each address.

### `setKeeperRegistryAddress` Function

#### Parameters
| Name                            | Description                                                          |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `keeperRegistryAddress`         | Address that requires updating in `KeeperRegistry`                   |

Only the `keeperRegistryAddress` can `performUpkeep`, which is a *global setting*. `KeeperRegistry` addresses can be found on the [Keepers app](https://keepers.chain.link/). However, only the owner can set a new `KeeperRegistry` after deployment.

### `setMinWaitPeriodSeconds` Function

#### Parameters
| Name                            | Description                                                  | Suggested Setting              |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| `period`                        | Minimum wait period (in seconds) for addresses between funding |  3600 (1 hour)               |

`period` denotes the length of time between top ups for a specific address. This is a *global setting* that prevents draining of funds from the contract if the private key for an address is compromised or if a gas spike occurs. However, only the owner can set a different minimum wait period after deployment.

### `topUp` Function

#### Parameters
| Name                            | Description                                                          |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `needsFunding`                  | List of addresses to fund (addresses must be pre-approved)           |

Any address can trigger the `topUp` function. This is an intentional design pattern that shows how easy it is to make an existing contract Keepers-compatible while maintaining an open interface. All validations are performed before the funding is triggered. If the conditions are not met, any attempt to top up will revert.
