MetaMask is a wallet that runs as a self-contained application inside your browser as an extension. It allows you to interact with Decentralized Applications or "dApps". MetaMask makes accessing the Ethereum & Testnet blockchains (Like Kovan) very easy and provides you with wallet addresses.

Go to: <a href="https://metamask.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer, noopener">metamask.io</a> and install the browser extension in Chrome or Firefox. 

* After installing the MetaMask extension, open the extension by clicking on the MetaMask Fox icon. If prompted to use the New Look, do so.
* Create a new vault.
* You will be presented with a 12-word mnemonic phrase; copy that phrase down in a very secure location that only you can access. 
* Change the network selection from `Main Ethereum Network` to the `Kovan Test Network`.
