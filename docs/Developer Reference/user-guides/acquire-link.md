* In order to see your LINK token balance in MetaMask, you will need to add the token.
* In MetaMask click the hamburger button, and click on `Add Token` and then `Custom Token`.
* On Kovan our LINK token address is: `0xa36085F69e2889c224210F603D836748e7dC0088`. Copy that address.

```text Kovan LINK Token
0xa36085F69e2889c224210F603D836748e7dC0088
```
```text Rinkeby LINK Token
0x01BE23585060835E02B77ef475b0Cc51aA1e0709
```

* Paste the token contract address into MetaMask in the Token Address input. The token symbol and decimals of precision will auto-populate. Click Next.
