}

Remix is a web IDE (integrated development environment) for creating, running, and debugging smart contracts in the browser. It is developed and maintained by the Ethereum foundation. Remix allows Solidity developers to write smart contracts without a development machine since everything required is included in the web interface. It allows for a simplified method of interacting with deployed contracts, without the need for a command line interface.

* Navigate to Remix: <a href="https://remix.ethereum.org/#version=soljson-v0.6.0+commit.26b70077.js&optimize=false&gist=9b71e0718d0ad3f2f9a6b2e4018cac82&evmVersion=null" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer, noopener">https://remix.ethereum.org</a>
* Remix opens up with an empty interface, or possible with a default contract

  "body": "If Metamask does not prompt you and instead displays the error below, you will need to disable \"Privacy Mode\" in Metamask. You can do this by clicking on your unique account icon at the top-right, then go to the Settings.

* A transaction link will be displayed at the bottom of Remix that displays deployment status. 
It will take a few moments for the contract to be deployed. The Remix UI will update upon completion.

![Remix Transaction Confirmation Message](/files/8ff4abe-remix7.jpg)

* On the left side panel there is a section that displays the title of the contract (example `ATestnetConsumer at 0x123...890 (blockchain)`).

* You can click on it to interact with your contract.

* You can't do anything to this contract except read its state until you send LINK to it.
