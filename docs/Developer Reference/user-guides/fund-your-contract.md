This guide explains how to fund your Solidity contract with LINK using the Remix IDE.

# Retrieveing the contract address 

* Deploy your contract and wait until you see a new contract in the `Deployed Contracts` section.
* Copy the contract address to your clipboard using the copy icon located near the contract title on the left side panel.

# Sending LINK

* Open MetaMask; click the hamburger (â˜°) button at the top-left corner.
* Click on the LINK token, then press `Next`.
* Paste your contract's address in the recipient field and enter a value for the amount to send (e.g. 10 LINK).
* Click `Confirm` and wait until the transaction is processed.
